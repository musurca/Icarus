    Determine wind speed and direction by taking distance and bearing
    to a fixed reference point over a time interval.

    1) Point your aircraft on a course directly toward
       or directly away from a fixed reference point 
       with distance measuring equipment (e.g., a VOR), 
       then set autopilot to maintain heading, altitude, 
       and speed.
    2) Record distance to reference point, start the 
       clock, and wait. Longer time intervals will 
       produce more accurate results. 300-600 seconds 
       (5-10 minutes) is ideal.
    4) After X seconds, record the new distance to 
       reference point as well as your plane's 
       deviation from its bearing.
    5) Enter numbers into program to determine 
       wind speed and direction.
